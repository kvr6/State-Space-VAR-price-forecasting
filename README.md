# State-Space Models and VAR for Price Forecasting

## Description

This repository explores the application of state-space models and Vector Autoregression (VAR) for forecasting prices in financial markets (e.g., commodities, FX). It provides a practical implementation of these techniques using Python and relevant libraries.

## Methodology

* **State-Space Models:**  State-space models provide a framework for modeling time series data by representing the underlying system as a set of hidden states and observations. These models are particularly useful for capturing the dynamics of complex systems.
* **Vector Autoregression (VAR):** VAR models are used to analyze the relationships between multiple time series variables. They are suitable for understanding the interconnectedness of different markets and forecasting their future values.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Load, clean, and prepare the data for model training.
2. **Model Training:** Train the state-space and VAR models on the preprocessed data.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
4. **Visualization:** Visualize the forecasts and compare them to the actual prices.
